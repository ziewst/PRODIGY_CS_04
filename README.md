**password complexity checker**


This code defines a function check_password_strength that evaluates the strength of a given password based on several criteria: minimum length (8 characters), having at least one uppercase letter, at least one lowercase letter, at least one number, and at least one special character. The function returns a message and a strength indicator. The main function prompts the user to input a password, then calls check_password_strength and prints the result and password strength. The program then checks whether the password meets the complexity requirements or not.
